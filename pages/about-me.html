                    My name is Akshat Saraswat and I currently study at <a href='http://didi.ac.ae/'> Dubai Institute of Design and Innovation</a>
                    I come from a family of Doctors in India. Some fields I would like to explore are the interaction between humans and machines in the sense of how
                    a dialogue is formed between the machine and the human in a way which would be benificial to both of them. I am also very interested in the emerging
                    field of Augmented Reality and the avenues it opens up for traditional businesses such as furniture shops to showcase their products to customers
                    without physically interacting with them.
